# Email Setup Instructions for Appointment Booking

## ðŸ“§ Setting up Email Notifications

To enable email notifications when appointments are booked, you need to configure your email credentials.

### Step 1: Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following content:

```env
# Email Configuration for Nodemailer
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### Step 2: Gmail Setup (Recommended)

#### Option A: Using Gmail with App Password

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
   - Security â†’ 2-Step Verification
   - App passwords â†’ Generate app password
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Copy the generated 16-character password
3. **Update `.env.local`**:
   ```env
   EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
   ```

#### Option B: Using Other Email Services

**Outlook/Hotmail:**
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-password
```

**Yahoo:**
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@yahoo.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### Step 3: Test the Setup

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the appointment page
3. Fill out and submit the appointment form
4. Check your email for the confirmation

### Step 4: Production Deployment

For production (Vercel), add the environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your project in Vercel
2. Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add:
   - `EMAIL_USER` = your-email@gmail.com
   - `EMAIL_PASS` = your-app-password
